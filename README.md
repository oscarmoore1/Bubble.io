# Bubble.io

The motivation for this project comes from an asisgnment for INFO1111 aimed at developing my self-learning skills.

My use case for this project:

Although a messaging app by itself would be highly useful, there are hundreds of much
better alternatives already accessible. I decided to add an extra component to my app:

-The app would consider the location of the user
-I would have pre-defined group chats that could only
be accessed when the user was physically within the pre-defined radius.
-The app would suggest group chats that fall within the physical radius of the user.
With the above requirements, the app would qualify as something that I would find useful
to communicate with friends in my vicinity
